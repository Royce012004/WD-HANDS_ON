        <h1>Power</h1>
        <p>Power possesses the corpse of an unknown woman or girl with long hair. She mainly appears being blonde. Her hair color varies from blonde to pink in manga illustrations, even appearing dirty blonde in some official art, and appears strawberry blonde in the anime. As a Fiend, she has red and yellow eyes that form a cross pattern, sharp teeth with defined fangs, and light red horns protruding from the top of her head. If Power accumulates too much blood, her horns become larger and more curved, and she can sprout additional pairs of horns from the sides of her head.</p>
